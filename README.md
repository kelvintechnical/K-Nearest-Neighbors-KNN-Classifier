# <h1>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier</strong> project! This repository contains code to implement a basic machine learning classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. This algorithm classifies data points based on the majority class of the closest data points, or "neighbors."</p>

## <h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The <strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier</strong> is a simple and effective classification algorithm that works well with smaller datasets and is easy to understand. In this project, we use Python libraries like <code>numpy</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, and <code>scikit-learn</code> to build and test our KNN model on the popular Iris dataset, classifying different species of iris flowers based on physical features.</p>

## <h2>Importance of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm</h2>

<p>The KNN algorithm is commonly used because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s a straightforward introduction to machine learning classification.</li>
  <li>It’s useful for pattern recognition, especially in image and recommendation systems.</li>
  <li>It provides practical experience with supervised learning.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Code Explanation</h2>

<p>Here is an overview of the key components of the code in this project:</p>

```python
# Importing Libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the KNN model
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test the model
accuracy = knn.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Model accuracy:", accuracy)
```

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>data = load_iris()</code>: Loads the Iris dataset, which contains data for classifying iris flowers.</li>
  <li><code>train_test_split</code>: Splits data into training and testing sets.</li>
  <li><code>KNeighborsClassifier</code>: Initializes the KNN classifier with <code>n_neighbors=3</code>.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Project Applications</h2>

<p>This project serves as a foundational example of a KNN classifier and can be expanded upon in various ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pattern Recognition</strong>: Use KNN to recognize patterns and classify data in different fields, such as image classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Portfolio Building</strong>: Showcase this project in your machine learning portfolio as an example of classification.</li>
</ul>
